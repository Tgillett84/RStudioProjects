#Instead of using head, use subsetting to get the first five rows of data
retail_trans[1:5,]

#or you can write it like this

retail_trans[c(1,2,3,4,5),]

#you can see if both ways are equal or logical
retail_trans[1:5,] == retail_trans[c(1,2,3,4,5),]

#Save your first five rows
five_rows<- retail_trans[1:5,]

#Make a new dataframe with only columns 1 and 4
invoice_quantity <- retail_trans[,c(1,4)]

#For a quick view to see if it ran
invoice_quantity

##Another way to subset columns
#to get the columns that you are looking for

retail_trans[,c("Invoice", "Quantity")]

#or

retail_trans[1:10,c("Country")]

#View the customers that came from the country France
unique(retail_trans$Country)
retail_trans[retail_trans$Country == "France",]

#View the invoices that are only specific to France, or your country
retail_trans[retail_trans$Country == "France",1]

#Make a dataset only for the Country
france <- retail_trans[retail_trans$Country == "France",]

#View the columns that have negative amounts of Quantity
retail_trans[retail_trans$Quantity <=0,]

negativeData <- retail_trans[retail_trans$Quantity <=0,]

#You can view these negatives in the summary as well
summary(retail_trans)

#Removing negatives
retail_trans$Quantity[retail_trans$Quantity <= 0] <-0

summary(retail_trans)
retail_trans[retail_trans$Quantity <=0,]
